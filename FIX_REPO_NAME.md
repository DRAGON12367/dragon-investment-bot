# Fix Repository Name Issue

## Option 1: Use a Different Name (Easiest)

In Streamlit Cloud, try one of these repository names:
- `ai-investment-bot-dragon`
- `dragon-investment-bot`
- `crypto-ai-bot-dragon`
- `ai-trading-bot-2024`
- `dragon12367-ai-bot`

Then create the repo on GitHub with the SAME name.

## Option 2: Connect to Existing Repo

If you already created the repo, just select it from the dropdown in Streamlit Cloud instead of typing the name.
